This portfolio is a simple website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website consists of three pages - Home, Projects, and Contact.

The Home page displays a hero image and some information about the owner of the portfolio. The Projects page displays some of the owner's projects in a grid layout with images and short descriptions. The Contact page displays a form that visitors can fill out to send a message to the owner.

The JavaScript code in this portfolio handles the form submission on the Contact page by encoding the form data and redirecting the user to their email client with a new message composed with the encoded form data.
